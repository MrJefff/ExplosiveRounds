This plugin gives explosive bullets a little bit more "kick". Makes it so there is an explosion effect where the bullet lands.

## Notes
- **A list of a few other explosion effects are listed on lines 25 - 30 in the plugin source. Change these via the "Explosion Effect" setting in the config.**

## Permissions
- `explosiverounds.use`
